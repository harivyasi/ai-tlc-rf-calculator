"""Django settings for the TLC RF Calculator project.

Runtime configuration is driven by environment variables so the same image can
run in development and production:

    DEBUG                  Enable debug mode (default: False).
    SECRET_KEY             Optional: nothing here signs data (see below).
    ALLOWED_HOSTS          Comma-separated allowed hosts.
    ELN_ORIGIN             The ELN origin (e.g. https://eln.example.org). Sets
                           both the CSP connect-src and the fetch allowlist.

A minimal deployment needs only ALLOWED_HOSTS and (for ELN save-back)
ELN_ORIGIN. Advanced overrides — CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS,
CSP_CONNECT_SRC, ELN_ALLOWED_HOSTS, MAX_IMAGE_MB, MAX_IMAGE_MEGAPIXELS,
MAX_UPLOAD_MB, MEDIA_MAX_AGE_HOURS, MEDIA_SWEEP_MINUTES, IMAGE_JOB_RESERVE_MB,
IMAGE_JOB_WAIT_SECONDS, IMAGE_CACHE_MB, SECURE_* — are all optional and default
sensibly.

# value in the cookie with the one the page sends back).

# Django still requires a key, so when SECRET_KEY is not set a random one is
# made at start-up. That key differs per start and per worker process. This
# is harmless only while nothing signs data: if you add logins, sessions,
# messages or signed cookies/links, set SECRET_KEY to one fixed secret in the
