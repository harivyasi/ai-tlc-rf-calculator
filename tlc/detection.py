"""Machine-learning-assisted candidate annotation (SI section 6).

Two YOLOv8s detectors propose editable candidates; nothing here produces a
final result. The logic is Shilpa Bai Thotli's, from her ``auto_detect_spots``
and ``auto_detect_lines`` views:

* **Spots (TLC-SpotDet).** Inference runs only on the horizontal strip between
  the baseline (Min) and the solvent front (Max), widened by
  ``TLC_BAND_MARGIN`` px; candidates whose centre falls outside the band
  itself are dropped. The spot centre is the centre of the predicted box. If a
  Plate Area is set, the strip is also limited to its x-range.
* **Lines (TLC-LineDet).** The most confident box of each class is taken, and
  the two are assigned **by position** -- the lower one is the baseline, the
  upper one the solvent front -- because image geometry, not the class label,
  defines the TLC semantics. With only one line found, it is assigned by which
  half of the image it lies in and the other line is estimated at 10 % / 90 %
  of the image height. If a Plate Area is set, the model sees only that box
  (an addition to Shilpa's tool: on uncropped photos with a busy background
  the model otherwise tends to put a line on the background).

All coordinates in and out are original-image pixels (after any rotation).
